                <p>Japan boasts some of the world’s highest internet speeds, with widespread availability of fiber-optic connections.</p>
                <p>5G networks are rapidly expanding, and public Wi-Fi is common in major cities, making connectivity easier than ever.</p>

                Wi-fi is literally everywhere you go in Japan. It is beaming out of shops and people’s bags at every hour of every day. No doubt if data was actually visible it would be almost impossible to see 1 meter in front of you. 
            </p>
            <p class="wifi-info">
                Despite all this though, the wi-fi which is actually accessible with no strings attached (free of charge or non-afflicted with a phone company) is almost impossible to find. It is almost ironic that due to the initial mass popularization of mobile internet via mobile phones, the entire need for free public wi-fi has been compromised.
            </p>
            <p class="wifi-info">
                While for the average person that lives in Japan this shortcoming doesn’t even register as a problem, for people that are visiting from abroad or don’t have the means to buy a mobile phone or pocket wi-fi (you need a ‘residence card’ in most cases) this is a massive problem.                 Especially considering that by using the internet, many of the communication problems that were the No.2 biggest difficulties for tourists could be avoided as well — online dictionaries and maps being especially useful. Hello two birds, one stone.
