                    With a packet communication network connected between the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University, 
                    operation of a network called “N-1 network” was launched. The N-1 network gradually expanded as more 
                    universities and colleges joined it.

                    Japan's first national-scale network, “N-1 network,” was launched in October 1974 through a joint 
                    study by the University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation.
